<h1>School project</h1>
<p>We had to create a simple game using an external library, written in Python.</p>
<b>My SSD gave up and the only file that was backed up is the almost finished script, where you can only play as white but the game is still playable. It has about 90% of the features compared to the original.</b>
<p>The requirements were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>at least 1 Python script</li>
    <li>game is playable</li>
    <li>use of external library</li>
</ul>
